### Chapter 3: Early Cities and Urban Reform

-   Canada became "urban" (more urban dwellers than rural) \~ 1920

-   Urbanization was facilitating industrialization

    -   based on resource extraction

-   Inner city rail allowed expansion to suburbs (1880, St Henri was one of first industrial suburbs)

-   Suburbs were initially created for middle-class, wealthy elites to live outside the city due to pollution

-   Eventually there were working class suburbs as well

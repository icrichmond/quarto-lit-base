4 case studies for the broad legacy effects of humans in terrestrial landscapes. Tree abundance, species composition, and forest structure are all dependent on past land-use types and logging intensity. Land-use equally affects soils and their structures. Recovery from legacy effects varies a lot depending on the system and past land-use. Historical landscapes are required to understand current ecosystems.

Keywords: Urban ecology, [[sustainability]], design, [[foundational]]	  

Distinguishes five urban ecological perspectives from three traditions: ecology in cities, [[ecology of cities]] as socioeconomic structures, and ecology of cities as ecosystems: bio-ecology perspective, socio-ecology, urban systems, integrative urban ecosystems, and urban landscape ecology perspective. None of the current perspectives are enough to ensure sustainability in cities.The landscape ecology approach allows all the previous approaches to be integrated together and could help develop urban sustainability. The metropolitan landscape is arguably the most effective focal level of study for urban sustainability.

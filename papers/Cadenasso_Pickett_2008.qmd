5 urban principles point to ecosystem functions that translate to services in urban landscapes: 1) cities are ecosystems 2) they are heterogeneous 3) they are dynamic 4) human and biophysical components interact 5) biophysical processes remain important. Cities have biotic and physical complexes, the basis of an ecosystem. But they also have social and built complexes. The uniqueness of a city is its complexity. Heterogeneity is fine-scaled within cities.Cities are composed of structures, vegetation, and surfaces.Spatial heterogeneity in cities has a temporal dimension.

Relationships between biodiversity and human aesthetic response are complex. Recovery from mental fatigue requires settings to escape the routine environment (often large natural spaces are thought of as a good environment for this)

Relationship between restorative effect and various ecological factors is varied.

Created typology of 9 planting types for woodlands, shrubs, and herbaceous veg.

-   Planting types varied across gradients of **planting structure** and **species character**

-   species character is derived from appearance on a gradient of native to non-native

-   structure is layering of plants

-   posit that character + structure = "naturalness"

-   also recorded % vegetative surface covered by flower

Distributed questionnaires about the aesthetic qualities, restorative effects, and perceived biodiversity value

-   vegetation community = 9 planting types

-   character, % flower cover, and vegetation community were all significant variables on aesthetic effect

-   structure, vegetation community, and % flower cover + demography influenced restorative effect

-   species character, vegetation community, and % flower cover influenced perceived biodiversity

"Human land use is one core component within historical ecology, which focuses on understanding the importance of past events to ecosystems, and the long-term legacies of these effects, or lags in ecosystem response". Humans have direct (land-use change) and indirect (disturbance regime changes) effects on ecosystems. Past land use may oersust as legacies in ecosystems. Distinguishes between land-cover changes and land-use changes. Resilient and slow adapting ecosystems experience more legacy effects.

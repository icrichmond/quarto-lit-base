Introduces a rapid assessment tool to scope the [[spatiotemporal]] arrangement of ES. Worked with the municipality to decide which ES to investigate. Assessed regulatory and cultural ES and used [[land cover]] scenarios to develop potential outcomes of different modelling scenarios. Had a pre-colonial land cover layer, current layer, and predicted future layer. Provisioning services are critically compromised within the city, however, they can be outsourced to outlying areas. [[regulating ecosystem services]] cannot be outsourced and their loss is critical. Education value is important and you lose access when development occurs.

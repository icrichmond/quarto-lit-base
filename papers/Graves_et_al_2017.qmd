Graves RA, Pearson SM, Turner MG (2017) Species richness alone does not predict cultural ecosystem service value. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 114:3774â€“3779. <https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1701370114>

Focusing solely on biodiversity and species richness to provide CES may not be enough to meet the population's needs - need to determine suitable indicators for the situation

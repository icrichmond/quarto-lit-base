Keywords: Ecosystem services, conservation [[planning]], ecosystem function	 

Many ES are critical to survival while others enhance it. Break down [[management]] of ES into subtopics: identifying ES providers, determining aspects of community structure that influence function, assessing key environmental factors, measuring spatiotemporal scale of operation.Examples of efficiency measures, functional units, spatial scale, ES. Species richness ([[biodiversity]]) is not the only relevant measure in the diversity-function relationship. Loss of function may depend on specific species. Can take an ESP or function centered approach to measurements. Four step framework proposed.

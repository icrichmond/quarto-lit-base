Urbanization is associated with decreased ES but there has been increasing quality of life globally – could be due to time lags. Vegetation C strage is primarily linked to tree size, which is depending on past land-use and management. Cultural ES also experience legacies. A need to quantift how past land-use determines the distribution of present-day ecosystem service provision. Measured 8 ES hypothesized to be influenced by historical land use and management. Generated past land cover using data over 150 yeears – topographical maps. Historical land cover offered better explanation for variation in 5/8 ES than current land cover: C storage, bird density, bird richness, number of users, and continuity with past. Provision of ES varies temporally.

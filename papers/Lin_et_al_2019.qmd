The urban forest contains all trees, shrubs, lawns, and pervious soils in urban areas. Reviewed model practices of urban forests over the  past two decades. Most ES papers are in NA and Europe with temperate/continental climates. Most papers occur on a microscale level. Outlines most relevant journals to publish in. [[iTree]] is most dominant model used in urban forest modelling. Quantifies most popular modelling techniques and ES measurements. Majority of papers used bottom-up approaches. Most studies looked at the biophysical benefits of ES with pollutant removal the most common ES studied. Location of the study within and across cities greatly affects the production of ES.

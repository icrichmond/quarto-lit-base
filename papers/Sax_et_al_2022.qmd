"Green gentrification1 occurs when the installation of new, improved, or remediated urban green space attracts increased investment and developer attention, forcing residents who are unable to adapt to the increased costs of living to relocate (Anguelovski et al., 2019; Curran and Hamilton, 2012; McClintock, 2018a)"

-   this does not have to be physical displacement: it can be a sense of exclusion or different usage of spaces

-   mid 1990s marks the start of sustainability discourse in urban planning (due to health concerns)

-   cities are responding to issues in "urban green equity" without responding to concerns re: green gentrification

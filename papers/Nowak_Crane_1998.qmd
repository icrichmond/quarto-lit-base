UFORE was developed to help managers and researchers quantify urban forest structure and its functions. A quantifies forest structure, B quantifies VOC emissions, C quantifies carbon storage and sequestration, D quantifies hourly pollution removal. A uses field data of the forest. Discusses how each model works - good methods paper. Includes sampling [methods](../topics/Methods.qmd)

Heatwaves are increasing due to climate change and are exacerbated in cities due to the urban heat island effect. Suburbs have higher forest [[canopy cover]] and therefore lower land surface temperatures (LST). Most research occurs at a coarse resolution and large-scale - major gap in how small-scale and localised greening impacts LST at different city scales. [[private trees]] contained a disproprtionately high percent of tree canopy and herbaceous cover. Land use class of each land unit was the least important factor affecting local LST. Highest ranked model was dependent on scale of measurement. Landscape scale influence of vegetated cover on LST was found.

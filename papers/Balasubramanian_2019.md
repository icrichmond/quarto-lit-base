First meta-analysis of regulating ecosystem services at the global level. 60% of ES have declined from 1960-2000. Regulating ES benefit people every day but are rarely valuated economically because they are not bought or sold in the market. In reality, regulating ES are worth billions of dollars. Lack of valuation means they are often left out of decision-making processes. Based on 100 published articles from 1997 - 2015, the total value amount of regulating ES is valued at $29085.185 billion USD. Goes through the individual values of a range of regulating ES.

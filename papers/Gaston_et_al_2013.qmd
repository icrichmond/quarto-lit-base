Human urban populations typically obtain most of their ecosystem resources from sources that are distributed over a larger area. Urban areas have a significant level of ecosystem services and processes happening within their borders. Green spaces are extremely [heterogenous](../topics/Heterogeneity.qmd) and small. Urban areas are temporally dynamic. Spatial flows of ES are highly constrained across urban landscapes. Very large numbers of land managers present in urban environments. "Wicked problem"

Landscape ecologists focus on relationships of pattern and process and many rely on remote sensing. Recent advances in remote sensing - explosion of data diversity and availability, emergence of massive-throughput analysis platforms [[Google Earth Engine]], development of algorithms for large-scale image classifications (many based on machine learning). Advances in landscape ecology using remote sensing - quantifying landscape structure at various spatial and temporal extents. Table showing best soures for different scales. Future prospects - there are increasing opportunities for image classification and fine-scale analysis with the release of new data and satellites. Using multiple sources and data types can create novel insights.

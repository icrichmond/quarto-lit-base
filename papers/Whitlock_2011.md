Public data archiving is an important part of science for many reasons. Most important step is to archive data in a public and long-lasting forum. Archiving data allows result verification, better meta-analyses, new questions, increased citation, new opportunities for teaching, and reduces data loss. Make it usable to strangers and to yourself in many years. Use non-proprietary formats such as txt and csv files. Important to respect original authors when re-using data. Journals also have a vital role in data archiving. Data collectors, users, and editors all have an important role to play in data archiving and availability.

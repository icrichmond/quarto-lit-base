Cities are in areas with high [biodiversity](../topics/Biodiversity.qmd) and house rare species. There is a narrative that cities don't have conservation value. Habitats in urban environments are rarely protected by policy and are considered expendable. Small patches contribute valuable habitat and connectivity. Valuing small spaces of habitat and recognizin and embracing unconventional habitats such as cemeteries can contribute to urban conservation. Developing creative actions can also help. Lastly, minimizing future impacts is key.

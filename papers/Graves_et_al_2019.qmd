Many CES depend on biodiversity and the supply of CES relies on functional traits of biotic communities. Birdwatching has increased steadily in popularity and is a biodiversity based CES. Managers need to know where CES are produced but ALSO where they can be accessed and where they are used. Cool methods. Users of CES may be interested in other aspects of biotic communities, not just biodiversity.

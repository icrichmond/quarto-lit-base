Meaningful participation, consensus building, and people-centredness are central elements of sustainability initiatives. Consensus building is a universal goal of sustainability initiatives - but planners have a wide range of demographic groups in a community and all people experience and evaluate commmunities differently. Government actors and citizens do not understand the other's perspective, making sustainable [[planning]] impossible.

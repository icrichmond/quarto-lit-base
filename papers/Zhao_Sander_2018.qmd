Primary ES data are rarely available, meaning studies often map secondary land use and [[land cover]] proxies. Urban ES is a special case because urban areas are so spatially [[heterogeneity]] that the wrong data could lead to high mapping error. All models underestimated carbon storage – correlations varied across urbanization levels. Overall, LUC models had different spatial distributions of C storage than what was actually observed and this effect increases with increased landscape htereogeneity. Coarse-scale LUC data performed worse than fine-scale LUC data.

Keywords: Meta-analysis, [biodiversity](../topics/Biodiversity.qmd), urban ES  

Most papers only assess 1 ES, rarely including 3 or more (in a single city). Regulating ES were most common. ES related to climate and/or weather were the majority. Most biodiversity-ES assessments found a non-correlative relationship. Most use habitat type classifications in their assessments.

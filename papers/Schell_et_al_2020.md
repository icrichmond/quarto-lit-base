Cities produce novel environmental conditions that can drive phenotypic shifts, emigration, or extinction. Social inequality remains understudied as a key driver of eco-evo change in cities. Various ecological attributes in cities are principally governed by the [[spatiotemporal]] scale of social inequities.Variation in wealth are the most commonly explored social variables that ecologists use. [[luxury effect]] s often scale from individuals to neighbourhoods to cities. Highly urbanized landscapes can have negative income-richness relationships due to high rises, etc.  Neighbourhood racial composition can be a stronger predictor of urban socio-ecological patterns than wealth. [[historical]] influences of systemic race and classism may influence patterns of species colonization and extinction. Environmentalism in the US was invented by white men with the idea of "pristine nature". Amazing conceptual diagrams.

Earth observations via remote sensing provide opportunities to measure ES levels and beneficiaries at a local and global scale. There are continuous variables from EO products other than land use that can be used to assess ES – e.g. leaf area index. Need to create models that accomodate spatial [heterogeneity](../topics/Heterogeneity.qmd) and within-pixel variability with EO data. EO data can be used for the next generation of ES modelling.

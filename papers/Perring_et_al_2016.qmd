"Land use legacies are the abiotic and biotic properties found at a site, due, at least in part, to the influence of land-use history (Foster et al. 2003)"/"land-use history is the sometimes complex successive sequence of human uses that a site has undergone (REFS)". Contrasting legacies mean that even for seemingly identical systems at present, they are on different trajectories of change.

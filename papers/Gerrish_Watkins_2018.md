Systemic review and meta-analysis of urban forest cover and its relationship to income. Aggregated many city specific studies to estimate effect size. Meta-analysis in urban ecology is important because it synthesizes literature that may not interact - interdisciplinary. Aggregation is a difficult factor because services provided by trees vary in their scale. Using satellite imagery inherently assumes that you believe that every square meter of canopy cover provides the same services - not necessarily the case. Overall there is a statistically significant relationship between urban forest cover and [[income]] (mostly US based). Advocate for correction RE: spatial autocorrelation.

[[land cover]] and land-use based measures are convenient but limited - urban land cover types are not well estimated using this and coarse resolution leads to ES over/underestimation. Focus on understudied areas for gathering new field data. We need cross-boundary and cross-scale research. Urban ES are mediated by non-ecological elements (ie physical infrastructure, social practices, etc.). Value of an ES depends on physical characteristics and number of beneficiaries. Relationships between biodiversity and ES in cities are unclear. Biodiversity values each unique species equally whereas ES perspective values those species contributing the most - inherently have conflict. ES research isn't implemented in policy because of complex language and a disconnect between research and policy needs.  Cross-city comparisons are fundamental and highly needed. 7 insights for how research should progress.

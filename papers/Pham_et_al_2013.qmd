Urban vegetation is unevenly distributed, raising environmental equity concerns. Separate trees/shrubs from lawn and separate public and private vegetation. Used Quickbird satellite images. Neighbourhood age, presence of parks, and distance to city centre are all significant variables in tree models. Presence of detached houses is the most important predictor of tree/shrub [canopy cover](../topics/CanopyCover.qmd). Individual boroughs vary in their vegation composition. Urban vegetation is spatially autocorrelated. Built environment indicators were more important than the sociodemographic variables. Sociodemographic factors were more important for trees than lawns.

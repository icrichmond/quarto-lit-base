There are benefits to urban trees but the benefits have limitations. Effectiveness of tree planting is dependent on [[scale]]. Urban trees are most effective at providing ES that operate at local scales, such as parcels or urban forest/neighbourhood patches. Urban trees are more useful at providing climate adaptation than mitigation. Small green spaces may have large impacts on human [[health]], which is perhaps the more important things since the small amount of greenspace allocated in cities canâ€™t sequester enough [[carbon storage]] (for example) to make a difference.

Present [[land cover]] patterns are shaped by past landscape patterns - complexity occurs when we consider the changes in patterns and processes as well as stability. Cause-effect relationships can be repeated and lead to accumulated "time lags". If we understand patterns, processes, and pathways over time, we can preserve ES for the future. Succession following human land-use change is a key cause of time lags affecting the landscape pattern. Ancient land use practices impact ecosystem patterns and processes to this day. Propose using path dependence to understand legacy effects in ecology.

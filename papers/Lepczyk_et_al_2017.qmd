Urban green spaces comprise a range of habitat types and most are novel ecosystems. Not all urban green spaces have equal value. How large do patches have to be to support urban [biodiversity](../topics/Biodiversity.qmd)? How are animal population sizes limited by green spaces during their life cycle? How does heterogeneity within and across green spaces affect animal and plant assemblages? How connected should green space be to support biodiversity? When are green spaces more likely to act as ecological traps or population sinks?

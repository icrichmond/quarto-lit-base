Managing forests for C storage and biodiversity is a common goal – is it possible. Forest studies on biodiversity-ecosystem function have ignored landscape structure. Measured connectivity using frag-stats. Large managed forest fragments had highest C stocks. Species richness was highest in connected, unamanaged fragments and lowest in connected, managed fragments. Functional dispersion lowest in large, managed fragments. Functional diversity was a significant predictor of C stocks. Biodiversity conservation can lead to increased quantities of C stored at the landscape scale. Increasing connectivity may strengthen the synergy between biodiversity and C.

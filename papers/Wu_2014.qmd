Keywords: Urban ecology, [biodiversity](../topics/Biodiversity.qmd), ES, review, [foundational](../topics/Foundational.qmd)  	

Quality of life is increasing despite decreases in ES due to urbanization. High human population density and extensive impervious surface area sufficently define what is urban. Interdisciplinary science was the foundation of urban ecology. Urban ecology was missing from mainstream journals until late 1980s-early 1990s. Adds “sustainability of cities” to ecology “in” and “of” cities – conceptual diagram. Urban ecology has different definitions in different fields. Ecosystem services bridge the gap between urban ecology and [sustainability](../topics/Sustainability.qmd). Urban ecology has its roots in sociology. Good history/foundation of urban ecology.

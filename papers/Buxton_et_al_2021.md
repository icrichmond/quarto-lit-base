Buxton RT, Bennett JR, Reid AJ, **Ziter, C.** et al (2021) Key information needs to move from knowledge to action for biodiversity conservation in Canada. Biological Conservation 108983. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2021.108983

Keywords: Ethical space, [[Indigenous knowledge]]	  

[[Canada]] has diverse biomes, relies heavily on natural resource sectors, and 72% of Canada's population lives in urban areas that represent < 0.2% of land area. Identified top 50 information needs through surveys, workshops, and online discussion. Found 5 key concepts about the nature of information needed to combat biodiversity loss: Indigenous knowledge systems are required, approaches to translate existing info into action, engaging with data scientists to address critical info management needs and synthesize existing data, inclusion of social science perspectives, the scalability of information needs. Prioritized 50 specific information needs in six categories: review and evaluate existing conservation policies and actions, understand mechanisms to build and mobilize public support and facilitate transformative change, conduct targeted research for planning and [[management]], monitor the status and trends of biodiversity, understand major threats to biodiversity and how they might be addressed

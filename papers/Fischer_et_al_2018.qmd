Urban [[parks]] provide [[regulating ecosystem services]] and play a pivotal role in delivering cultural ES. People’s sociocultural backgrounds cause differences in how they use greenspaces. Physical park uses were the most prevalent in each city and across Europe more generally. Taking a walk was most common physical use and relaxing was most common social use and experiencing nature was most common nature use. Sociocultural backgrounds significantly influenced park use. Urban recreational ecosystem services depend on the local context.

Opportunities for urban greening are limited and urban trees do not provide ubiquitos "good" for all actors in all contexts. Need to consider placement, beneficiaries, alternatives, who is responsible for costs, etc. Benefits are social constructs that are context specific. ES anaylses need to be grounded in their particular biophysical and social contexts. Tree [[canopy cover]] has a significant health outcome with regards to the city's microclimate. Street trees provide [[temperature mitigation]] outside and within buildings. Decreased temperatures and light during the winter due to trees could be bad for human health. Trees increase surface roughness and the area of the ground surface taht atmospheric pollutants come into contact with - potentially reducing air pollution. Large leaves remove more gaseous pollutants than small ones. Canopies change urban air flow regimes potentially improving air quality. Trees emit VOCs in response to stress and they can contribute to ozone formation but levels are species dependent. Introduction of natural sounds improves perception of the quality of the soundscape - trees have the potential to alter the soundscape. Pollen can have negative health effects. Urban greenery has impacts on mental health of urban residents.

Residential yards contain most of the green space,  vegetation, and trees in most cities. Front and back yard structure are often significantly different. Front yards are often based on socioeconomic values of a neighbourhood. Used residential parcel polyhons, LiDAR data and high-resolution imagery (all open data). Backyards had significantly greater [canopy cover](../topics/CanopyCover.qmd) than front [yards](../topics/Yards.qmd) and greater canopy height, max height, and vegetation volume.

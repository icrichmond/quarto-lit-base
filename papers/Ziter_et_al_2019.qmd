Urban air temperature relies on fine-scale [[heterogeneity]] of urban areas (e.g. tree canopies covering pavement). Air temperature at the intraurban fine-scale is sparse. Air temperature decreased nonlinearly with increasing tree canopy cover and effects were larger at broader scales. Air temperature increased linearly with increasing impervious cover. Increasing [[canopy cover]] was more effective at reducing temperature than decreasing impervious cover. Effect was more pronounced during the day. Reducing impervious surfaces decreases temperatures at night – very important.

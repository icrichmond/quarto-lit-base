The unequal intangible benefits obtainable from urban green spaces can be potential core drivers of social injustice in cities. Gentrification is when neighbourhoods built, retail, and social environments combined with changes in demographic composition that increases socioeconomic residents and displaces vulnerable populations. The greater the amount, size and quality of urban green amenities, the more displacement occurs. Gentrified green spaces had high levels of aesthetic and recreation services, [[parks]] that were not gentrified had cultural identity and socialization services. non-gentrified parks have smaller total surface of green area.

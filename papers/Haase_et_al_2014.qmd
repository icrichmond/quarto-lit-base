Locally generated ES have substantial impacts on the quality of life in urban areas. 60% of ES are degraded or used unsustainably. Good intro background of ES. Geographic distribution of UES studies is highly skewed to the Western world. Majority of studies use a spatial approach - important to note that although land use can remain the same over time, its character may change. Two types of indicators - state and performance. ES supply has been modelled more frequently than ES [[ecosystem service demand]]. Papers often fall short on policy recommendations. Stakeholdder involvement is a fundamental element of ES research.
